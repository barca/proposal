# CSCI S-33a: Project Proposal
## Due: Friday, July 27 at 6pm

#### Your name
Tyler Harden

#### Your teaching fellow's name

Alex

#### Which language(s) will you use for your project?

Python, JS

#### What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Love Again

#### In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (e.g. "A website that lets you check the weather in different cities.")

I would like to make a simple dating site for individuals with HIV/AIDS, with user profiles, a discovery mechanism and chat feature. 

#### Where will your project ultimately live? (e.g. within CS50 IDE, Heroku, AWS, some commerical web host...)

Heroku

#### In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will it do? What features will it have?

I would like to make a dating site for people with STDs such as HIV/AIDS as many sites I have found online are either poorly implemented or appear to be fairly expensive.  This will require having a simple homepage, signup/signin, user profiles, discovery and chat mechanisms.  Further it will likely need some form of email communication.

- In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

#### In a sentence or list, define a GOOD outcome for your project. What WILL you accomplish no matter what?

	The site will have a home page, user signup, signin, profiles, discovery and some way to contact other parties.

#### In a sentence or list, define a BETTER outcome for your project. What do you THINK you will accomplish in time?

	Sexual Orientation preferences, image uploads and improved profiles


#### In a sentence or list, define a BEST outcome for your project. What do you HOPE you will accomplish in time?
	
	in-app chat feature, improved discovery


#### In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills do you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?


I will begin by identifying designing a few of the pages, speicfically the home page, profiles and discovery.  The profile wil likely need two versions of this page (one for user creation, one for visitors).  From there I will need to add functionality by creating the models, and linking the pages with the backend.  This will likely acomplish my first task.  I am initially uncertain about how I will model sexual orientation which I am limiting to be men-men, men-women, women-women inclusive of bi-sexual orientations. I am only modeling men and women as genders as I believe that it will get too complicated to move beyond that within this timeframe. I will likely use the Amazon AWS API to upload images.  Finally I will try to create a real time chat feature similar to project 2 for the in-app chat feature.  Improved discovery is open ended as I have to research match making systems.
